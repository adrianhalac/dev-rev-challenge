# This is my submission for the Dev Rev coding challenge

To get started, simply run:

### npm start

The project contains the BubbleGraph component inside of App.js.

The component is flexible, and is able to contain data sets with any labeling (3 data, 1 title).

The graph is able to be scaled such that separate axes can be made to be longer or shorter than needed.
There are X and Y scale buttons that allow to dynamically adjust the scale of the axes.

There is a 'see-through bubbles' toggle button. This allows to make the bubbles more opaque in order to look at the axes properly if needed.

The component itself has a few options:

- Initial Y/X scales
- Whether to display scaling buttons
- How many 'ticks' to have per axis (precision)
- The name of the data for each axis

# This was fun. I hope you enjoy it :)
